# Scuffed-Shooter

Scuffed Shooter is a simple top-down shooting game where all you have to do is shoot your opponent.
The controls are simple:
Player 1 moves with WASD and shoots with the SPACE bar.
Player 2 moves with the arrow keys and shoots with CONTROL.
Once one of the players reaches a score of 50, they win and the game is over. In order to play again, you must close and reopen the window.

Scuffed Shooter was created by Zach Burkholder for his final project for CS3330 - Object Oriented Programming at the University of Missouri in Columbia.
